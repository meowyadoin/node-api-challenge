## Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

  Express middleware and Express' server-side routing

## Describe Middleware?

Function that does some work for you before it gets to the main actions. It can be to check for good requests, check for authentication, and anything else you design custom middleware for.  

## Describe a Resource?

  Data that is stored in a database; hardware or software that is accessible by the computer, network, or another object connected to a computer. Pretty much everything is a resource.

## What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

  Status codes in the 200s or returning the object.

## How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

  Server-side routing. Set up a router for each section of resources you have.
